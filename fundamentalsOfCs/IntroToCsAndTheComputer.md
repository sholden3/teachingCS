# Intro to Cs and our Computer

Here I assume you have no, or very little knowledge of what Computer Science is. I also assume that if you had to describe what a computer is, you would hestiate momentarily before spouting out sometype of nonsense over how the internet is made up of a series of tubes, and that the monitor is actually the computer as that is where the visuals come out of. Which there is nothing wrong with at all. If you are pass that point in your learning, maybe still read through this, as you never know what you may learn.

So with this out of the way, let us go ahead and start with our journey!

## What is Computer Science

The first question we should have is pretty simple, what is computer science? It is such a fundamental question that so many people have trouble answering, and naturally is our starting position. So let us define what exactly computer science really is. At the highest level, we can view computer science as the process of solving a problem. Now obviously this definition abstracts away a lot of what makes computer science what it is, but it is a good stepping stone that we can build up as time goes by. To build on this a little more, we can further denote that computer science involves the process of taking some type of input, and from that input, generating some type of output. There, now that definition has a little bit more meat on it.

By taking this new definition, we can break it down into three steps:

1.  Input for the problem
2.  The Black Box (Where the computer comes into play as well as the algorithm)
3.  The output produced from the Black Box

At the most basic level, this is how we can view computer science. Just a way that we take our inputs for our problem, manipulate it in some way through an algorithm on our computer, and then produce an output with the intention of solving our initial problem. Don't worry about the term Black Box. For now, when you encounter it, just think of your computer, and how you don't truly understand what is going on inside of it, but you do know that it is responsible for generating your output.
