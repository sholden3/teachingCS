                Path to Computer Science Literacy

            <p>
                One of the big things in my journey to teach my self computer science, is how can I take what I learn, both in my personal journey, as well as my professional journey, and create an all encompassing curriculum for others to follow. How can I take the many lessons I learned, the paths I have foolhardely followed, and set up a course that will teach you what you need to know in a non-shallow fashion.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, I am not saying that I learned every single thing there is to know in my journey, nor am I saying that I am the expert and you should take everything I say as gospel. Instead, what I am proposing is a path for students, prospective students, and hopefuls to follow to get you up to the point of getting your first interview, and hopefully more.
            </p>
            <p>
                In order to do this, I suggest following through in the order I present. When I have branching trees, you may follow those trees, and the subjects do not feed into each other in any meaningful way. If I set up a path for your to follow web development, versus game development, you can choose one or the other. If in the game development path, we cut our teeth on webgl, I will teach you just enough to set up a static website. If you want to learn more, you will need to follow the web development path.

                Currently, this will flow into the following path:

                I will have all of these for free, and will add onto them as I learn new things, as well as slowly fill this out over time. If you do want to help support me, I will have my patreon linked for all.
